## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Kyler
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW: 7hrs
* What gave you the most trouble: I don't feel very comfortable interpriting residual plots. Not sure how to fit the best model to data. Spent a lot of time trying to get the actual rmd to look good knitted, still feel like it doesn't. I didn't know how to plot a model with many different predictor variables for 1 d. 
* Any comments you have: I didn't love working with the polution data because I don't really understand it. Usually when I run regressions, I'm running them on data for which I have some reference point. Maybe I know if it seems like different variables would logically be coorelated, or can quess the sign of their coefficient. Here I couldn't really do that, so trying to predict outcomes felt a bit weird.

## Question 1:

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
url <- "http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/pollution/pollution.dta"
pollution <- read.dta(url) %>% 
  tbl_df()
```

### a)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6, message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}

ggplot(pollution, aes(x=nox, y=mort)) +
  geom_point(shape=1) + geom_smooth(method=lm)+
  labs(x= "Relative nitric oxides pollution potential", y= "Total age-adjusted mortality rate per 100,000")+
  ggtitle("Mortality Rate vs. Nitric Oxide Level")+
  theme_minimal()

```
<br>
<br>
\[ Mort = \beta _{0} + nox\beta _{1} +  \varepsilon  \]

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6, message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}

m1 <- lm(mort~nox, pollution)  #Create a linear model

kable(summary(m1)$coef, digits=2)
```
<br>
<br>

A simple linear regression does not seem to be very effective in describing the fit of these data. Though there are several outliers, the data is heavily concentrated between 0 and 50, and rather is sparse otherwise. There appears to be significant variation in mortality rates for low rates of relative nitric oxides pollution potenial. Visually, the regression line accounts for almost none of the variation in the data, which is supported by the low R-squared, which at 0.005987 suggests that this model explains only 0.05% of the variation in mortality rates.

<br>
<br>
```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}
resid_m1 = resid(m1)
ggplot(pollution, aes(x=nox, y=resid_m1)) +
  geom_point(shape=1)+
  labs(x= "Relative nitric oxides pollution potential", y= "Residuals")+
  ggtitle("Residual Plot")+
  theme_minimal()

qqnorm(resid_m1, main ="Normal Probablity Plot")
qqline(resid_m1)

```

According to the residual plot and the Q-Q Plot, the residuals seem to be fairly normally distributed, although there seems to be some abnormality to the tails.

### b)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
ggplot(pollution, aes(x=log(nox), y=mort)) +
  geom_point(shape=1) + geom_smooth(method=lm)+
  labs(x= "Log of relative nitric oxides pollution potential", y= "Total age-adjusted mortality rate per 100,000")+
  ggtitle("Mortality Rate vs. Log Nitric Oxide Level")+
  theme_minimal()

m2 <- lm(mort~log(nox), pollution)  #Create a linear model

resid_m2 = resid(m2)
ggplot(pollution, aes(x=nox, y=resid_m2)) +
  geom_point(shape=1)+
  labs(x= "Log relative nitric oxides pollution potential", y= "Residuals")+
  ggtitle("Residual Plot of Lin-Log Model")

```


Logging the independant variable leads to a model with a much higher R squared, accounting for 8% of variation in the data. The residuals still look normal.

### c)

\[ Mort = \beta _{0} + log(nox)\beta _{1} +  \varepsilon  \]

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
kable(summary(m2)$coef, digits=2)
#a 1% increase in nox is associatiated with an increase of 15.335 in mortality rate per 100,000
```

This model associates a 1% increase in relative nitric oxides pollution potential with an increase of 15.335 deaths per 100,000.

### d)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
m3 <- lm(mort~log(nox) + log(hc) + log(so2), pollution)  #Create a linear model

resid_m3 = resid(m3)
ggplot(pollution, aes(x=nox, y=resid_m3)) +
  geom_point(shape=1)+
  labs(x= "Log relative nitric oxides pollution potential", y= "Residuals")+
  ggtitle("Residual Plot of Multiple Predictor Model")+
  theme_minimal()

```


\[ Mort = \beta _{0} + log(nox)\beta _{1} +log(hc)\beta _{2}+log(so2)\beta _{3} +  \varepsilon\]

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
kable(summary(m3)$coef, digits=2)
```

This model proves to be much more effective at describing the data than the previous models. It accounts for 31% of the variation, which is interesting because the coefficients are actually quite low.
